/* The button is set up as a DigitalIn object and is attached to pin PC_13.
Two LEDs are set up as DigitalOut objects and are attached to pins.
Led1 is initially configured as ON (1) and led2 as OFF (0).
The loop never stops detecting whether the button is pressed. Button == 0 shows that the button is pressed since the button is active-low.
The LEDs' statuses are toggled and the flag is set to true to stop further toggling until the button is released if the button 
is pushed and the flag is false (signaling that the button press has not been handled).
The LEDs can be toggled with the next press when the button is released (button == 1). This resets the flag to false.
After the LEDs are toggled, a 200 ms delay (wait_us(200000)) is added to the button 
to debounce it and prevent mechanical bounce from causing repeated toggles with a single press.
Every time you pressÂ the button, the LEDs will toggle. The LEDs only toggle when the button is pressed;
releasing it has no effect on them. Even if the button is held down for a long time, the flag makes sure that every button hit results in exactly one toggle.
